# Simon
The game is called Simon. Simon displays a sequence of colors on each tile. The player must click the tiles in the same sequence as shown by the computer in order to pass the level. As levels progress, color sequences increase in length and complexity. 
## Why Simon?
I chose Simon because it is engaging and relies on a players memory. Unlike many other games that require the player to have technical skills in order to do well, Simon doesn't require that. It's a simple point and click game, but can still challenge your brain.
